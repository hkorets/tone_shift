### DISCLAIMER FOR OUR FINAL PRESENTATION 
I, Khrystyna Korets, broke our previous git repository pushing 23 GB of data there, it was really painfull for other teammates to perform pull & push so we decided to create new one cause I didn't knew how to slve that, but it is a lesson that I learned :) <br>
